# AstralRetro

A resource pack with an ultra-retro vibe. With 64 colors to choose from, minimalism shines here.

# Style guide

Only the AstralRetro palette can be used.

For every material there should only be one neutral, highlight, and shadow color. Overlapping highlights and shadows call for lighter or darker colors, if possible.

The top and left edges of a face must always be the highlight color. The bottom and right edges of a face must always be the shadow color.

The entire texture's edges are shaded as described, and overlaps other faces. This is usually done last.

The bottom-left corner of a face is dominated by what color is on the left. The top-right corner is dominated by what color is on the right.

Sharp corners are preferred highly over curves.
